          <p>
          Graduated as an art major from Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, she obtained an Arts Endorsement diploma in Visual Arts. She has gained a strong foundation of various mediums of art such as painting, illustration, and digital media. Character illustration is considered as one of her strong skills.
          <p>
          As a recent Media Studies-Emerging Media graduate from Hunter College, Catherine digged deeper into the digital age of design such as graphic design and web design coding. Her sense of color, composition, typography and especially her keen eye for details have sharpened. Design to her, is a bit more challenging compared to illustration however she is always enthusiastic to overcome them and take it on with creative ideas. After all, illustration and designing is what she enjoys the best!

          I am an artist and a web designer! I enjoy illustrating mostly in a cartoonish style and creating comics to make one's day somewhat brighter. Other than illustrating, I have an interest for graphics and web design. The web and digital medium are growing and I hope to apply my creativity to create a better aesthetic and user experience for everyone to enjoy.
